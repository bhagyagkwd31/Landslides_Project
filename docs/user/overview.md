# No-More-Landslides Overview
The No-More-Landslides project is designed to help users, ranging from citizens to government authorities, predict the likelihood of a landslide in a given region. The application provides a form, prompting the user for values that the user can funish and providing reasonable defaults for everything else.

# Prediction Process
The model has been trained on a significant amount of data. This allows the project to be used independently, without external help.

The main result generated by the application is the likelihood of a landslide.

The landslide likelihood calculated by the model is presented to the user on the UI.

# Key Concepts
To remain simple and easy to use, the application has been trained on a large amount of data.

## Stages
The application operates on the notion of passing data through stages. Similar to other applications which go through a graph of steps (e.g. Email spam detector, handwriting recognition), each stage represents a step in the graph.
The application goes through the following stages:
1. data-input - The data input by the user. The application assumes defaults for the parameters not entered by the user.
2. validation - basic input sanity checks
3. model - The pre-trained watsonx.ai model which is run on the data input.
4. landslide-likelihood - The likelihood of a landslide occurring the region entered by the user.
